<Steps>
  <Step title="Download the Script">
    1. Visit the <a href="https://keymaster.fivem.net/" target="_blank">Cfx.re Keymaster</a>.<br/>
    2. Log in using the <b>account that made the purchase</b>.<br/>
    3. Go to the <b>Granted Assets</b> tab.<br/>
    4. Find Revo Backup and click <b>Download</b>.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Extract the Script">
    - Extract the downloaded <code>.zip</code> file.<br/>
    - Inside the extracted folder, you'll find a folder like <code>revo-backup</code>.
    <Warning>
      <b>Do not rename</b> the script folder (e.g., <code>revo-backup</code>) â€” this will break escrow validation.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Move Script to Server Resources">
    Move the script folder into your server's <code>resources</code> directory.
    ```bash
      /resources/[revo]/revo-backup
    ```
    <Tip>
      You may organize Revo scripts under a <code>[revo]</code> folder.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install Dependencies">
    Make sure you have oxmysql installed and configured:
    ```bash
      ensure oxmysql
    ```
    <Note>
      oxmysql must be started <b>before</b> Revo Backup in your server.cfg.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Script to server.cfg">
    In your <code>server.cfg</code>, add the script after dependencies:
    ```bash
      # Dependencies first
      ensure oxmysql
      
      # Then Revo Backup
      ensure revo-backup
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure Database Connection">
    Ensure your database connection is properly configured in your <code>server.cfg</code>:
    ```bash
      set mysql_connection_string "mysql://username:password@localhost/database_name?charset=utf8mb4"
    ```
    <Note>
      The script will use your server's MySQL connection string. Fallback database settings are available in the config file if needed.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Restart Your Server">
    Restart your server to load the script.
    <Note>
      Full server restart is required to ensure proper initialization.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

1. **Check Console:** Look for "Revo Backup loaded successfully" message
2. **Test Commands:** Try `/backup` or press `F6` to open the UI
