---

<Warning>
  **CRITICAL:** Before updating, you **MUST** copy your backup files and metadata. Failure to do so will result in **permanent loss of all your backup history and files**.
</Warning>

Keeping Revo Backup up-to-date ensures access to the latest features, improvements, and bug fixes. However, updating requires special attention to preserve your existing backups.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Visit CFX.re Keymaster">
    Go to the <a href="https://keymaster.fivem.net/asset-grants" target="_blank">CFX.re Keymaster Granted Assets</a> and log in using the same CFX account used to purchase the script.

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Download the Latest Version">
    Locate Revo Backup in your granted assets and download the latest available bundle.
    <Note>
      The latest version will always be available in your asset grant. There's no need to repurchase.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Backup Your Current Backup Files">
    Before replacing the old script, you **MUST** copy these files from your current `revo_backup` folder:
    
    <Warning>
      **DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP!** Your backup files and metadata are stored in the script folder. If you don't copy them, you will lose:
      - All your backup history
      - All your `.sql` backup files
      - Backup metadata and labels
    </Warning>
    
    1. Navigate to your current `revo_backup` folder in `resources`
    2. Copy the following to a safe location (temporary folder):
       - `backup_metadata.json` - Contains all backup history and labels
       - All `.sql` backup files (e.g., `backup_2024-01-15_12-00-00.sql`)
    3. Also backup your `config.lua` if you've made custom changes
    
    <Tip>
      You can copy the entire `revo_backup` folder as a backup before proceeding, or just copy the files mentioned above.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Replace the Old Script">
    1. Unzip the newly downloaded script bundle
    2. Open your server directory and navigate to the <code>resources</code> folder
    3. Delete the old version of the `revo_backup` folder
    4. Move the new script folder into the <code>resources</code> folder
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Restore Your Backup Files">
    **CRITICAL STEP:** Copy your backup files back into the new script folder:
    
    1. Copy `backup_metadata.json` into the new `revo_backup` folder
    2. Copy all your `.sql` backup files into the new `revo_backup` folder
    3. If you backed up `config.lua`, restore your custom settings
    
    <Info>
      The new version will recognize your existing backups and continue tracking them properly. Your backup history, labels, and all SQL files will be preserved.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Restart or Refresh the Resource">
    You can either restart your server or refresh the resource using:
    ```bash
      refresh
      restart revo_backup
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Verification

After updating, verify that your backups are intact:

1. **Check Backup Files:** Navigate to `revo_backup` folder and confirm all `.sql` files are present
2. **Check Metadata:** Verify `backup_metadata.json` exists and contains your backup history
3. **Test UI:** Open the backup UI (`/backup` or `F6`) and verify all backups are listed
4. **Verify Labels:** Check that all your backup labels are still visible

<Warning>
  If you notice any backups missing after updating, immediately restore from your temporary backup folder. Never delete the temporary backup until you've confirmed everything is working correctly.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  Always keep a separate backup of your backup files in a different location (outside the server directory) as an extra safety measure.
