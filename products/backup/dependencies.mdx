## Installation Order

Make sure your `server.cfg` has the correct startup order:

```bash
# Dependencies (must start first)
ensure oxmysql

# Revo Backup (starts after dependencies)
ensure revo-backup
```

<Info>
  The script will automatically detect if oxmysql is not running and display appropriate error messages in the server console.
</Info>

## Database Requirements

Revo Backup works with any MySQL/MariaDB database that oxmysql supports:

- **MySQL 5.7+**
- **MySQL 8.0+** 
- **MariaDB 10.3+**

<Tip>
  For best performance, ensure your database server has sufficient storage space for backup files, especially if you're running frequent backups.
