  Configuration is done in the `config.lua` file located in the `revo_fpsbooster` directory.
</Info>

## Command Configuration

Set the command players use to open the FPS Booster menu:

```lua
Config.OpenCommand = 'fps' -- Change this to any command you prefer
```

## Automatic (AI) Mode Thresholds

Adjust FPS thresholds for the Automatic (AI) preset:

```lua
Config.OptimalFps = 60
Config.LowFpsThreshold = 30
Config.HighFpsThreshold = 80
Config.UltraHighFpsThreshold = 100
Config.SuperUltraHighFpsThreshold = 120
```

These values control how the AI mode adapts graphics settings based on player FPS.

## Notification Position

Choose where notifications appear on the screen:

```lua
Config.NotificationPosition = 'top-center'
```

Available positions:  
`'top-left'`, `'top-right'`, `'top-center'`, `'bottom-left'`, `'bottom-right'`, `'bottom-center'`, `'center-left'`, `'center-right'`, `'center-center'`

## Localization

Set the default language for the UI:

```lua
Config.DefaultLocale = "en"
```

Supported languages: `'en'`, `'fr'`, `'es'`, `'de'`, `'it'`, `'pt'`, `'ru'`, `'ar'`, `'tr'`, `'pl'`, `'zh'`

You can further customize text and labels in the `Config.Locales` table.

<Tip>
  Most players will get the best results using the Automatic (AI) preset, which adapts settings based on their FPS in real time.
