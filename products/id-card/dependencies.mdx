<Info>
  Revo EcoWipe depends on **oxmysql** for handling database operations. Please ensure it is installed and properly configured.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download oxmysql">
    Go to the <a href="https://github.com/overextended/oxmysql/releases" target="_blank">oxmysql releases page</a> and download the latest release zip file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add to Resources">
    Extract the downloaded `oxmysql` folder and place it inside your server's `resources` directory.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure server.cfg">
    Add the following line to your `server.cfg` <b>before</b> revo_ecowipe to ensure oxmysql starts first:
    ```bash
      ensure oxmysql
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Make sure oxmysql is included **before** EcoWipe in your `server.cfg` to avoid runtime errors.
