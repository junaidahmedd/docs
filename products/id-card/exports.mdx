## Integration Example

### Admin Command Example
Here's a complete example of an admin command that gives a driver license to a player:

```lua
-- Command to give driver license to a player
RegisterCommand('givelicense', function(source, args, rawCommand)
    local playerId = tonumber(args[1])
    
    if not playerId or playerId <= 0 then
        print("^1[DEBUG] Invalid player ID: " .. tostring(playerId) .. "^0")
        TriggerClientEvent('chat:addMessage', source, {
            color = {255, 0, 0},
            multiline = true,
            args = {"System", "Usage: /givelicense [player_id]"}
        })
        return
    end
    
    local playerName = GetPlayerName(playerId)    
    if not playerName then
        print("^1[DEBUG] Player not found for ID: " .. playerId .. "^0")
        TriggerClientEvent('chat:addMessage', source, {
            color = {255, 0, 0},
            multiline = true,
            args = {"System", "Player not found!"}
        })
        return
    end

    -- Create driver license using the export
    exports['revo_idcard']:CreateDriverLicense(playerId)
    
    TriggerClientEvent('chat:addMessage', source, {
        color = {0, 255, 0},
        multiline = true,
        args = {"System", "Driver License given to " .. playerName}
    })
    
end, false)
```

This example shows:
- Proper argument validation
- Debug logging for troubleshooting
- Error handling for invalid inputs
- Using the export to create the license
- Feedback to both admin and target player

## How Exports Work

The exports trigger a client-side event that initiates the mugshot capture and ID card creation process. The system works asynchronously through a client-server communication flow.

**Complete flow when you call an export:**
1. **Export called** → Triggers `revo_idcard:requestMugshotAndCreateID` client event
2. **Client-side** → Handles mugshot capture and sends data back via `revo_idcard:receiveMugshotAndCreateID`
3. **Server-side** → Receives mugshot data and triggers `revo_idcard:issueRealID` event
4. **Final creation** → `issueRealID` handles player data fetching and actual item creation

<Note>
  The exports are fire-and-forget - they start the process but don't provide immediate feedback. Success/failure is handled through the internal event system.
</Note>

## Notes
- The player must have sufficient inventory space for the card to be created
- Cards are created with default settings as configured in the main config file
- These exports work with all supported inventory systems (ox_inventory, qb-inventory, qs-inventory)
