## Integration Examples

### Police Job Integration
```lua
-- Give a driver license when player completes driving test
RegisterNetEvent('police:drivingTestPassed')
AddEventHandler('police:drivingTestPassed', function()
    local playerId = source
    exports['revo_idcard']:CreateDriverLicense(playerId)
    TriggerClientEvent('chat:addMessage', playerId, {
        args = {'^2Success', 'You have been issued a driver license!'}
    })
end)
```

### Client-Side Integration
Since exports are server-side only, you can trigger them from client-side scripts using custom events:

**Client-Side (Trigger Event):**
```lua
-- Client-side script
RegisterNetEvent('idcard:requestID')
AddEventHandler('idcard:requestID', function()
    -- Trigger server event to create ID card
    TriggerServerEvent('idcard:createID')
end)
```


**Server-Side (Handle Event):**
```lua
-- Server-side script
RegisterNetEvent('idcard:createID')
AddEventHandler('idcard:createID', function()
    local playerId = source
    -- Export triggers client event - no return value
    exports['revo_idcard']:CreateRealID(playerId)
    
    -- Note: Success/failure feedback would come from the client-side ID card system
    TriggerClientEvent('chat:addMessage', playerId, {
        args = {'^2Info', 'ID card creation process started.'}
    })
end)
```

### DMV Integration
```lua
-- Give an ID card when player registers at DMV
RegisterNetEvent('dmv:registrationComplete')
AddEventHandler('dmv:registrationComplete', function()
    local playerId = source
    exports['revo_idcard']:CreateRealID(playerId)
    TriggerClientEvent('chat:addMessage', playerId, {
        args = {'^2Success', 'Your ID card has been issued!'}
    })
end)
```

### Weapon Training Integration
```lua
-- Give a weapon license when player completes training
RegisterNetEvent('weaponTraining:completed')
AddEventHandler('weaponTraining:completed', function()
    local playerId = source
    exports['revo_idcard']:CreateWeaponLicense(playerId)
    TriggerClientEvent('chat:addMessage', playerId, {
        args = {'^2Success', 'You have been issued a weapon license!'}
    })
end)
```

## How Exports Work

The exports trigger client-side events that handle the ID card creation process. They don't return values immediately since the actual creation happens asynchronously through the client-side interface.

**What happens when you call an export:**
1. Export triggers a client event (`revo_idcard:requestMugshotAndCreateID`)
2. Client-side script handles the mugshot capture and ID creation
3. The actual card creation happens through the normal ID card system

**Note:** These exports are fire-and-forget - they don't provide immediate feedback about success or failure.

## Notes
- The player must have sufficient inventory space for the card to be created
- Cards are created with default settings as configured in the main config file
- These exports work with all supported inventory systems (ox_inventory, qb-inventory, qs-inventory)
