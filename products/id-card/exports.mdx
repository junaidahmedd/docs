## Integration Examples

### Police Job Integration

RegisterNetEvent('police:drivingTestPassed')
AddEventHandler('police:drivingTestPassed', function()
    local playerId = source
    exports['revo_idcard']:CreateDriverLicense(playerId)
    TriggerClientEvent('chat:addMessage', playerId, {
        args = {'^2Success', 'You have been issued a driver license!'}
    })
end)
```

### DMV Integration
```lua
-- Give an ID card when player registers at DMV
RegisterNetEvent('dmv:registrationComplete')
AddEventHandler('dmv:registrationComplete', function()
    local playerId = source
    exports['revo_idcard']:CreateRealID(playerId)
    TriggerClientEvent('chat:addMessage', playerId, {
        args = {'^2Success', 'Your ID card has been issued!'}
    })
end)
```

### Weapon Training Integration
```lua
-- Give a weapon license when player completes training
RegisterNetEvent('weaponTraining:completed')

    exports['revo_idcard']:CreateWeaponLicense(playerId)
    TriggerClientEvent('chat:addMessage', playerId, {
        args = {'^2Success', 'You have been issued a weapon license!'}
    })
end)
```

## Error Handling

The exports will return `true` if the operation is successful, or `false` if there's an error (e.g., invalid player ID, inventory issues).

```lua
local success = exports['revo_idcard']:CreateRealID(playerId)
if success then
    print("ID card created successfully")
else
    print("Failed to create ID card")
end
```

## Notes
- The player must have sufficient inventory space for the card to be created
- Cards are created with default settings as configured in the main config file
- These exports work with all supported inventory systems (ox_inventory, qb-inventory, qs-inventory)
