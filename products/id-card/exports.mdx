## Integration Examples

### Police Job Integration
```lua
-- Give a driver license when player completes driving test
RegisterNetEvent('police:drivingTestPassed')
AddEventHandler('police:drivingTestPassed', function()
    local playerId = source
    exports['revo_idcard']:CreateDriverLicense(playerId)
    TriggerClientEvent('chat:addMessage', playerId, {
        args = {'^2Success', 'You have been issued a driver license!'}
    })
end)
```

### Client-Side Integration
Since exports are server-side only, you can trigger them from client-side scripts using custom events:

**Client-Side (Trigger Event):**
```lua
-- Client-side script
RegisterNetEvent('idcard:requestID')
AddEventHandler('idcard:requestID', function()
    -- Trigger server event to create ID card
    TriggerServerEvent('idcard:createID')
end)
```


**Server-Side (Handle Event):**
```lua
-- Server-side script
RegisterNetEvent('idcard:createID')
AddEventHandler('idcard:createID', function()
    local playerId = source
    -- Export triggers client event to start mugshot capture
    exports['revo_idcard']:CreateRealID(playerId)
    
    -- Note: The system will automatically handle mugshot capture and ID creation
    -- Success/failure feedback comes through the internal event system
    TriggerClientEvent('chat:addMessage', playerId, {
        args = {'^2Info', 'ID card creation process started. Please look at the camera for your mugshot.'}
    })
end)
```

### DMV Integration
```lua
-- Give an ID card when player registers at DMV
RegisterNetEvent('dmv:registrationComplete')
AddEventHandler('dmv:registrationComplete', function()
    local playerId = source
    exports['revo_idcard']:CreateRealID(playerId)
    TriggerClientEvent('chat:addMessage', playerId, {
        args = {'^2Success', 'Your ID card has been issued!'}
    })
end)
```

### Weapon Training Integration
```lua
-- Give a weapon license when player completes training
RegisterNetEvent('weaponTraining:completed')
AddEventHandler('weaponTraining:completed', function()
    local playerId = source
    exports['revo_idcard']:CreateWeaponLicense(playerId)
    TriggerClientEvent('chat:addMessage', playerId, {
        args = {'^2Success', 'You have been issued a weapon license!'}
    })
end)
```

## How Exports Work

The exports trigger a client-side event that initiates the mugshot capture and ID card creation process. The system works asynchronously through a client-server communication flow.

**Complete flow when you call an export:**
1. **Export called** → Triggers `revo_idcard:requestMugshotAndCreateID` client event
2. **Client-side** → Handles mugshot capture and sends data back via `revo_idcard:receiveMugshotAndCreateID`
3. **Server-side** → Receives mugshot data and triggers `revo_idcard:issueRealID` event
4. **Final creation** → `issueRealID` handles player data fetching and actual item creation

**Note:** The exports are fire-and-forget - they start the process but don't provide immediate feedback. Success/failure is handled through the internal event system.

## Notes
- The player must have sufficient inventory space for the card to be created
- Cards are created with default settings as configured in the main config file
- These exports work with all supported inventory systems (ox_inventory, qb-inventory, qs-inventory)
