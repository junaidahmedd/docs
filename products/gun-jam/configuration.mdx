<Info>
  Configuration is done in the `config.lua` file located in the `revo_gunjam` directory.
</Info>

## Jam Chance

Set how often weapons jam. Lower values mean less frequent jams (more bullets between jams):

```lua
Config.JamChance = 3 -- Default is 3 (about 1 jam every 65 bullets)
```

## Reload & Unjam Settings

- **No Auto Reload:**  
  Require players to manually reload after a jam.

  ```lua
  Config.NoAutoReload = true -- true = manual reload required
  ```

- **Unjam on Death:**  
  Automatically unjam weapons when a player dies.

  ```lua
  Config.UnjamOnDeath = true
  ```

## Animation

Set the animation dictionary and name for the unjamming action:

```lua
Config.Anidict = "mp_arresting"
Config.Animation = "a_uncuff"
```

## Localization

Set the default language and customize notification messages:

```lua
Config.DefaultLocale = "en"
```

Supported languages: `"en"`, `"fr"`, `"de"`, `"es"`, `"ar"`, `"pt"`, `"it"`, `"tr"`, `"pl"`, `"ru"`, `"nl"`, `"sv"`

Example notification messages:
```lua
Config.Locales = {
  ["en"] = {
    unjamming_notification = "Unjamming Weapon",
    jammedweapon_notification = "Your weapon has jammed! ~r~Press the E key to unjam."
  },
  -- Add other languages here
}
```

## Ignored Weapons

Exclude specific weapons from jamming by setting them to `true` in the `IgnoredWeaponHashes` table:

```lua
Config.IgnoredWeaponHashes = {
  [GetHashKey("weapon_rpg")] = true,
  [GetHashKey("weapon_minigun")] = false,
  -- Add more weapons as needed
}
```

## Recoil Settings

Customize recoil per weapon by setting values in the `Recoils` table (lower values = less recoil):

```lua
Config.Recoils = {
  [453432689] = 0.3, -- PISTOL
  [3219281620] = 0.3, -- PISTOL MK2
  -- Add more weapon hashes and values as needed
}
```

<Tip>
  Adjust jam chance and recoil settings to balance gameplay.
