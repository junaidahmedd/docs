## Version-Specific Update Instructions

### Updating to v1.3

If you're updating to **v1.3** or later, you need to import a new database table:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Import Database Migration">
    Import the `trade_daily_limits.sql` file into your database:
    
    1. Locate the `trade_daily_limits.sql` file in the `revo_stocktrading` folder
    2. Open your database management tool (phpMyAdmin, HeidiSQL, etc.)
    3. Select your database
    4. Import the `trade_daily_limits.sql` file
    
    <Info>
      This table is required for the Daily Profit Cap, Daily Withdrawal Limit, and Progressive Tax System features introduced in v1.3.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify Database Table">
    After importing, verify that the `trade_daily_limits` table exists in your database with the following columns:
    - `identifier` (varchar)
    - `date` (date)
    - `profit` (decimal)
    - `withdrawal` (decimal)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **DO NOT SKIP** the database import step. The script will not function correctly without the `trade_daily_limits` table.
</Warning>

### Updating from v1.2 or Earlier

If you're updating from v1.2 or an earlier version to v1.3:

1. Follow all the general update steps above
2. **MUST** import `trade_daily_limits.sql` as described in the v1.3 instructions above
3. Review the [changelog](/products/stock-trading/changelog) to see what's new

## Verification

After updating, verify that everything is working correctly:

1. **Check Database:** Verify the `trade_daily_limits` table exists (for v1.3+)
2. **Test UI:** Open the trading UI and verify it loads correctly
3. **Test Trading:** Open a test trade to ensure all features work
4. **Check Configuration:** Verify your custom settings in `config.lua` are preserved

<Tip>
  If you encounter any issues after updating, check the server console for errors and ensure all database migrations have been applied.
