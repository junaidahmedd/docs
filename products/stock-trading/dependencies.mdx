<Info>
  Revo Stock Trading depends on **oxmysql** for database operations and is compatible with **ESX**, **QBCore**, and **QBox** servers only.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download oxmysql">
    Go to the <a href="https://github.com/overextended/oxmysql/releases" target="_blank">oxmysql releases page</a> and download the latest release zip file.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add to Resources">
    Extract the downloaded `oxmysql` folder and place it inside your server's `resources` directory.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure server.cfg">
    Add the following line to your `server.cfg` <b>before</b> starting Stock Trading so oxmysql initializes first:
    <CodeGroup>
      ensure oxmysql
    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Framework Compatibility">
    Ensure your server is running one of the supported frameworks: **ESX**, **QBCore**, or **QBox**. Other frameworks are not supported.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Load order matters. Start `oxmysql` before your framework and Stock Trading resource to avoid initialization issues.
