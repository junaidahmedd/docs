</Info>

## UI Opening Methods

Enable opening the trading UI via command or inventory item:

```lua
Config.UseCommand = true -- Allow opening UI with command
Config.OpenCommand = 'trade' -- Command to open the Revo Trade UI

Config.UseItem = true -- Allow opening UI with item
Config.ItemName = 'revo_trading_tablet' -- Item name for opening UI (if UseItem is true)
```

## Liquidation & Risk Control

Set the margin level at which all open trades are liquidated:

```lua
Config.LiquidationMarginLevel = 50 -- percent (liquidate at 50% margin level)
```

## Charting Library

Revo Stock Trading uses **lightweight charts** as the primary charting library, which provides fast performance and essential trading features. For advanced charting capabilities, Highcharts integration is also supported.

### Default Configuration (Lightweight Charts)
```lua
Config.ChartLibrary = "lightweight" -- Default: fast and lightweight
Config.HighChartsBaseURL = "" -- Leave empty for lightweight charts
```

### Highcharts Integration (Advanced Features)

For advanced charting features like candlestick charts, technical indicators, and detailed market analysis, you can integrate Highcharts:

```lua
Config.ChartLibrary = "highcharts" -- Enable Highcharts
Config.HighChartsBaseURL = "https://cdn.highcharts.com" -- Your Highcharts CDN URL
```

<Warning>
  **Important:** Highcharts is **not included** with Revo Stock Trading. We do not bundle licensed libraries in our scripts to avoid legal complications.
  
  Highcharts requires a commercial license for commercial use. Before using Highcharts:
  
  1. **Check your usage:** Determine if your FiveM server qualifies as commercial use
  2. **Get proper license:** Visit [Highcharts Licensing](https://shop.highsoft.com/) to purchase appropriate license
  3. **Use licensed CDN:** Use your licensed Highcharts CDN URL (without any path after `/`)
  4. **Compliance:** Ensure compliance with Highcharts terms of service
  
  **We recommend:** Start with lightweight charts and upgrade to Highcharts only if you have proper licensing.
</Warning>

<Note>
  The lightweight chart library provides excellent performance and covers most trading needs without licensing requirements.

## Permissions

Set which groups/roles can access the Stock Management UI:

```lua
Config.AllowedGroups = {
    admin = true,
    superadmin = true,
    god = true
}
```

## Notification Position

Choose where notifications appear on the screen:

```lua
Config.NotificationPosition = 'top-center'
```

Available positions:  
`'top-left'`, `'top-right'`, `'top-center'`, `'bottom-left'`, `'bottom-right'`, `'bottom-center'`, `'center-left'`, `'center-right'`, `'center-center'`

## Fixed Leverages

Set leverage values for different asset types:

```lua
Config.FixedLeverages = {
    stock = 10,
    crypto = 25,
    forex = 100,
    commodity = 30
}
```

## Contract Sizes

Set contract sizes for different asset types:

```lua
Config.ContractSizes = {
    forex = 100000,
    stock = 100,
    commodity = 1000,
    crypto = 1
}
```

## Deposit & Withdraw Limits

Set minimum deposit and withdrawal amounts:

```lua
Config.MinimumDeposit = 500
Config.MinimumWithdraw = 20
```

## Localization

Set the default language and customize all UI text:

```lua
Config.DefaultLocale = 'en'
```

Supported languages: `'en'`, `'es'`, `'fr'`, `'de'`, `'it'`, `'pt'`, `'ru'`, `'tr'`, `'pl'`, `'zh'`, `'ar'`

Customize all UI text in the <code>Config.Locales</code> table.

<Tip>
  Adjust leverages, contract sizes, permissions, and localization to fit your server's needs. For Highcharts, make sure to provide a valid library URL if you choose that option.
