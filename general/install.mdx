</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Your Assets on Cfx.re">
    1. Visit the <a href="https://keymaster.fivem.net/" target="_blank">Cfx.re Keymaster</a>.<br/>
    2. Log in using the <b>account that made the purchase</b>.<br/>

    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Extract the Script">
    - Extract the <code>.pack .zip</code> file you downloaded.<br/>
    - Inside the extracted folder, you’ll find a folder like <code>revo-stocktrading</code> or similar.
    <Warning>
      <b>Do not rename</b> the script folder (e.g., <code>revo-stocktrading</code>) — this will break escrow validation.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Move Script to Server Resources">
    Move the script folder (located inside the extracted bundle folder) into your server’s <code>resources</code> directory.
    <CodeGroup>
      bash
      /resources/[revo]/[script-name]
    </CodeGroup>
    <Tip>
      You may organize Revo scripts under a <code>[revo]</code> folder.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Script to server.cfg">
    In your <code>server.cfg</code>, ensure the script is loaded by adding:
    <CodeGroup>
      cfg
      ensure [script-name]
    </CodeGroup>
    ✅ Make sure this matches the exact folder name of the script.
    <Note>
      Replace <code>[script-name]</code> with the real name without square brackets. (e.g. <code>revo-stocktrading</code>)
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Restart Your Server">
    Restart your server to load the script.
    <Note>
      Full server restart is required to avoid any issues.
    </Note>
  </Step>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Could not verify entitlement'>
    This usually means that your server’s license key does not match the account that owns the asset.

    - Ensure you are logged into the correct CFX account.
    - Double check that your license key is linked to the same account from which you purchased the script.
    - Restart the server after fixing entitlement issues.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Script Not Appearing in Server Console">
    Confirm the folder name is <b>not renamed</b>, and the path is correct inside the <code>resources</code> folder.

    Run the following:
    <CodeGroup>
      bash
      refresh
      ensure [script-name]
    </CodeGroup>
