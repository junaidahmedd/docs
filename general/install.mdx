## Installing Revo Scripts (Escrow Protected)

Thank you for purchasing a Revo Script! This guide will walk you through installing your script using the **FiveM Escrow System**, which is a system FiveM uses to protect premium scripts.

### üì¶ Step 1: Download the Script

After purchasing, you'll receive a download link via **Tebex** or your email. Download the `.zip` file and extract it to a temporary location on your computer.

> Make sure you're logged into the **Cfx.re account** that purchased the script. This is important, as Escrow-locked files only work with the authorized account and server key.

---

### üìÅ Step 2: Place the Script in Your Server

1. Copy the extracted script folder into your server‚Äôs `resources` directory:
resources/[revo]/your-script-name


2. Do **not** rename or edit the folder structure or filenames inside the script. Doing so may break the script due to escrow protection.

---

### üîë Step 3: Configure Your Server Key

Ensure that your **FiveM server key** is tied to the same **Cfx.re account** that made the purchase.

- Visit: [https://keymaster.fivem.net](https://keymaster.fivem.net)
- Make sure your key is **active** and matches your server IP/domain.

---

### üßæ Step 4: Add to server.cfg

In your `server.cfg`, add the following line:
ensure your-script-name


Make sure to replace `your-script-name` with the actual folder name placed inside your resources.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Start Your Server

Now restart your server or run `refresh` and `ensure your-script-name` from your console.

> If everything is set up correctly, the script will start without errors and be ready to use!

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- If you see an error like `Could not verify entitlement`, make sure:
  - You're using the **correct Cfx.re account** and **server key**.
  - The **folder name and structure** haven‚Äôt been changed.
  - Your server is **connected to the internet** to verify license.
