<Info>
  Make sure you're logged into the correct **Cfx.re account** (the one used to purchase the script), and your server uses a matching **license key**.
</Info>

Follow these steps to install and activate your Revo Script using the FiveM Escrow system:

---

## Step 1: Go to Cfx.re and Access Your Assets

1. Visit the [Cfx.re Keymaster](https://keymaster.fivem.net/).
2. Log in using the **account that made the purchase**.
3. Go to the **Granted Assets** tab.
4. Find the Revo Script you purchased and click **Download**.

## Step 2: Extract the Script

- Extract the `.zip` file you downloaded.
- Inside, you’ll find a folder like `revo-fps-booster` or similar.  
- ⚠️ **Do not rename** this folder — escrow-protected scripts will break if the folder name is altered.

---

## Step 3: Move the Script to Your Server Resources

Extract the downloaded `.zip` file and place the script folder into your server's `resources` directory.

```bash
/resources/[revo]/revo-fps-booster
```

<Tip>
  You may organize Revo scripts under a `[revo]` folder, but do **not rename** the script folder itself (e.g., `revo-fps-booster`) — this will break escrow validation.
</Tip>

---

## Step 4: Add Script to server.cfg

In your `server.cfg`, ensure the script is loaded by adding:

```cfg
ensure revo-fps-booster
```

✅ Make sure this matches the exact folder name in your `resources` directory.

---

## Step 5: Restart Your Server

You can now restart your server to load the script:

```bash
refresh
ensure revo-fps-booster
```

You should see a confirmation message in your server console if the script has loaded correctly.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Could not verify entitlement'>
    This usually means that your server’s license key does not match the account that owns the asset.

    - Ensure you are logged into the correct CFX account.
    - Double check that your license key is linked to the same account from which you purchased the script.
    - Restart the server after fixing entitlement issues.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Script Not Appearing in Server Console">
    Confirm the folder name is **not renamed**, and the path is correct inside the `resources` folder.

    Run the following:
    ```bash
    refresh
    ensure revo-fps-booster
    ```
