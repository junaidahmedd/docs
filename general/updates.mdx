Keeping your Revo Scripts up-to-date ensures access to the latest features, improvements, and bug fixes.

### Step 1: Visit CFX.re Keymaster

Go to the [CFX.re Keymaster Granted Assets](https://keymaster.fivem.net/asset-grants) and log in using the same CFX account used to purchase the script.

### Step 2: Download the Latest Version

Locate the script you want to update in your granted assets and download the latest available bundle.

<Note>
  The latest version will always be available in your asset grant. There’s no need to repurchase.
</Note>

### Step 3: Replace the Old Script (Windows)

Unzip the newly downloaded script bundle. Inside, you'll find the updated script folder.

Now, replace the existing script:

1. Open your server directory and navigate to the `resources` folder.
2. Delete the old version of the script folder.
3. Move the new script folder into the `resources` folder.

Make sure the folder name is the same as the one used in your `server.cfg` (or update the config accordingly).

<Warning>
  Always back up your previous script folder and configuration files before replacing them with the new version.
</Warning>

### Step 4: Restart or Refresh the Resource

You can either restart your server or refresh the resource using:

```bash
refresh
restart [script-name]
```

That’s it! You’ve successfully updated your Revo Script.
