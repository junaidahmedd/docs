Keeping your Revo Scripts up-to-date ensures access to the latest features, improvements, and bug fixes.

### Step 1: Visit CFX.re Keymaster

Go to the [CFX.re Keymaster Granted Assets](https://keymaster.fivem.net/asset-grants) and log in using the same CFX account used to purchase the script.

### Step 2: Download the Latest Version

Locate the script you want to update in your granted assets and download the latest available bundle.

<Tip>
  The latest version will always be available in your asset grant. There’s no need to repurchase.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Replace the Old Script

Unzip the new bundle and copy the updated script folder.

Then, in your server directory:

```bash
cd resources
rm -rf [old-script-folder]
mv [new-script-folder] ./
```

Make sure the folder name is the same as the one used in your `server.cfg` (or update the config accordingly).

<Warning>
  Always back up your previous script folder and configuration files before replacing them with the new version.
</Warning>

### Step 4: Restart or Refresh the Resource

You can either restart your server or refresh the resource using:

```bash
refresh
restart [script-name]
```

That’s it! You’ve successfully updated your Revo Script.
