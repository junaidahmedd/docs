If you're experiencing issues with your script installation or execution, here are common problems and their solutions:

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Script Not Starting or Throwing Error on Server Boot">
    - Make sure the script folder is in the correct directory: `resources/`
    - Verify that you've added `ensure script-folder-name` (or `start`) in your `server.cfg`
    - Double-check if the folder name in your `resources` matches what's written in `server.cfg`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="You don't have access to the asset">
    This means your CFX account is not granted access to the asset or you're logged into the wrong account.

    - Go to [https://keymaster.fivem.net/](https://keymaster.fivem.net/) and log in with the account that purchased the script.
    - Check your [granted assets page](https://keymaster.fivem.net/marketplace/granted) to confirm access.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The script is not working as expected">
    - Ensure that all dependencies listed in the documentation are installed and started **before** the script.
    - Review the config files for any required adjustments.
    - Make sure your server artifacts are up to date.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Escrow system issues (unable to view code, missing files, etc.)">
    - Escrow-protected scripts have locked files by design. You won’t be able to view or modify protected files.
    - Ensure you're using the correct server version compatible with CFX Escrow.
    - Do **not** attempt to modify or decrypt locked files — this will break the script and violate terms.
